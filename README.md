# MN Celesta <a href="https://pprmint.de/projects/celesta" target="_blank"><img align="right" height="40" src="./docs/logo.svg"></a>

A sharp display serif adapted from the lovely [Instrument Serif](https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif) font to match my own preferences. Still work in progress.

## Changes.

### Sharper.
The main difference between Instrument Serif and MN Celesta is that Celesta isn't as soft. The serifs are pointier, corners are more angular and bumps in the likes of `Z` and `7` have been flattened.

### Stubbier.
The terminals found in glyphs like `a`, `d` and `t` have been changed to be a little stubbier and not go straight up, similar to the ss01 stylistic set of Instrument Serif. The `l` has also received this hook.

### Subjectively sleeker.
The balance of certain glyphs like `B` and `3` has been adjusted to make them less bottom-heavy. Other glyphs have been changed more noticeably, such as the `Q` which got a new tail at the bottom.
