# MN Celesta <a href="https://pprmint.de/projects/celesta" target="_blank"><img align="right" height="40" src="./docs/logo.svg"></a>

A sharp display serif adapted from the lovely [Instrument Serif](https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif) font to match my own preferences. Still work in progress.

## Changes.

### Sharper.
The main difference between Instrument Serif and MN Celesta is that Celesta isn't as soft. The serifs are pointier, corners are sharper and some bumps in certain glyphs like the `Z` and `7` have also been flattened.

Sure, Garamond might've been a soft guy, but my website's edgy.

### Stubbier.
The terminals found in glyphs like `a`, `d` and `t` have been changed to be a little stubbier and not go straight up, similar to the ss01 stylistic set found in the original font. The bottom end of the `l` has also been given this hook.

If you prefer the original flat version, it's still available as a character variant.

### Sleeker.
Subjectively, of course. The balance of some glyphs has been adjusted to make them slightly less bottom-heavy. Others have been changed a bit more substantially, like the `3` looking a bit more conventional, or the `Q` with a new tail at the bottom.

If you prefer the original design of the `Q`, it's still available as character variants as well.
