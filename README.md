# MN Celesta <a href="https://pprmint.de/projects/celesta" target="_blank"><img align="right" height="40" src="./docs/logo.svg"></a>

A sharp display serif adapted from the lovely [Instrument Serif](https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif) font to match my own preferences. Still work in progress.

## Changes.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/sharp.svg" width="300"/></p>

The main difference between Instrument Serif and MN Celesta is that Celesta doesn't have as many rounded corners. Some bumps in certain glyphs have also been flattened.

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/hook.svg" width="300"/></p>

The terminals found in glyphs like `a`, `d` and `t` have been changed to be a little stubbier and not go straight up, similar to the ss01 stylistic set found in the original font. The bottom end of the `l` has also been given this hook, though the original flat version is still available as a character variant.

The balance of some glyphs has been adjusted to make them slightly less bottom-heavy. Select glyphs like the `Q` have been redesigned more substantially, but their previous designs are still available as character variants.
